        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects
            and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video
            captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the
            complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we
            propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
            understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate
            visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine
            video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient
            object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content.
